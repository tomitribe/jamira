# Atlassian JIRA Command-Line (CLI)

Jamira is a command-line API for Atlassian JIRA using the Tomitribe CREST library.

## Installation

Jamira can be downloaded as a ready-to-go executable from Maven Central

----
curl https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/tomitribe/jamira/jamira-cli/0.1/jamira-cli-0.1.sh > /usr/local/bin/jamira
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/jamira
----

## Installation using JBang

Jamira can be installed and run with jbang - it will even setup java for you if you do not have that available.

---
curl -Ls sh.jbang.dev | bash -s app install jamira@tomitribe/jamira
jamira
---

## Completion 

Additionally, if you want command completion you can add the following to your `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc` or similar environment setup scripts:

----
source "$(jamira _completion -f)"
----

## Setup

Jamira has accounts in a similar way git has remotes.  An account can be setup using the `account add` command

----
Usage: account add  Name Username Password URI
----

The `Name` value should be any short identifier with no spaces and all lowercase.  Any other command that has an `--account` flag can use that identifier to locate the login information and URL of your desired JIRA server.

Example setup:

----
$ jamira account add apache elmerfudd "GetTh3Rabb1t" https://issues.apache.org/jira

$ jamira account list
  name    username             serverUri
-------- ----------- --------------------------------
 apache   elmerfudd   https://issues.apache.org/jira

### Create

Can create issues, versions and components.  For common issue types there are convenience commands; bug, improvement, new-feature, task, subtask.

----
$ jamira create
Missing sub-command
Usage: create [subcommand] [options]

Sub commands:

   bug
   component
   improvement
   issue
   new-feature

#### Create Sub-Task

Sub-tasks can be created by simply specifying the parent issue key and supplying a text summary to use for the new issue

----
$ jamira create subtask
Missing argument: IssueKey

Usage: create subtask [options] IssueKey String

Options:
  --account=<Account>               Shortname of the JIRA server
                                    (default: default)
  --affected-version=<String[]>     The names of the versions affected by the issue
  --assignee=<String>               Username of the person to which the issue should be assigned
  --component=<String[]>            The component names relating to the issue
  --description=<String>            Long description of the issue

----

### Bulk-create

When you have several issues you need to create it's advised to use the bulk API.

----
$ jamira bulk-create
Missing sub-command
Usage: bulk-create [subcommand] [options]

Sub commands:

   issues
   subtasks

----


#### Bulk-create Subtasks

Subtasks can be created in bulk using the following command.  The summary for each subtask is read
from the piped input stream.  This allows several lines of text to be generated on the command line
and each line becomes a subtask.

----
$ jamira bulk-create subtasks
Missing argument: IssueKey

Usage: bulk-create subtasks [options] IssueKey

Options:
  --account=<Account>               The shortname of the jira install configured via the `setup` command
                                    (default: default)
  --affected-version=<String[]>     The names of the versions affected by the issue
  --assignee=<String>               Username of the person to which the issue should be assigned
  --component=<String[]>            The component names relating to the issue
  --fix-version=<String[]>          The names of the versions affected by the issue
  --priority=<String>               The name of the priority for the issue
  --reporter=<String>               Username of the person who is the reporter of the issue

----

For example:

----
$ echo -e "Bulk insert"{1..10}"\n"
Bulk insert1
 Bulk insert2
 Bulk insert3
 Bulk insert4
 Bulk insert5
 Bulk insert6
 Bulk insert7
 Bulk insert8
 Bulk insert9
 Bulk insert10

$ echo -e "Bulk insert"{1..10}"\n" | jamira bulk-create subtasks TOMEE-3002
TOMEE-3021
TOMEE-3022

## Running as a Native Binary

_NOTE:_ Native binary support is at proof-of-concept level_ currently.
Not all commands are enabled for native mode yet.

Using https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] and https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM],
Jamira can be compiled down to platform specific native binaries,
resulting in faster execution times, as the overhead of starting up the JVM is avoided.

To build a native Jamira binary, make sure to have GraalVM installed,
https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image[as described] in the Quarkus documentation.
Then run the build using the _native_ profile:

----
mvn clean install -Pnative
----

The build will take some time, after which you can find a fully self-contained native binary under _jamira-cli-0.2-SNAPSHOT-runner_.
Here's a comparison of execution times from a MacBook Pro 2014 which show the improvements you can expect:

----
time ./jamira-cli/target/jamira list subtasks OPENEJB-142  3.51s user 0.30s system 133% cpu 2.851 total
time ./jamira-cli/target/jamira-cli-0.2-SNAPSHOT-runner list subtasks OPENEJB-142  0.06s user 0.06s system 12% cpu 1.022 total
